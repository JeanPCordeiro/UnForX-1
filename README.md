# UnForX-1

UnForX is a deterministic, VM-based operating system designed to run on
both general-purpose computers (x86) and embedded hardware
(Raspberry Pi, RP2350, ESP32).

It uses cooperative, system-enforced scheduling, a portable hybrid
stack/register bytecode virtual machine, FAT32 storage, and WiFi
networking to provide a unified execution model across radically
different platforms.
